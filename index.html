          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Mahabali also known as Bali, Indrasenan or MƒÅveli, is a Daitya king found in Hindu texts. He is the grandson of Prahlada and a descendant of sage Kashyapa. There are many versions of his legend in ancient texts such as the Shatapatha Brahmana, Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranas. According to legends, he was sent beneath the Earth into Patal or The Underworld by Vamana Avatar of Lord Vishnu.Mahabali is described in early Hindu history as a benevolent and generous king. He ruled without discrimination, and his people were honest, healthy and happy under his rule.Mahabali also temporarily possessed the amrita (nectar for eternal life) obtained by the asuras.The amrita allowed his associates to bring him back to life after his death in one of the wars between suras and asuras.Mahabali was, thus, immune from death.</p>

              After many wars, the invincible Bali had won heaven and earth. The suras (Devas) approach Vishnu to save them. Vishnu refused to join the war or kill his own devotee Mahabali. He used a tactical approach instead and incarnated as the dwarf Brahmin avatar, Vamana. While Mahabali was performing Ashvamedha Vedic sacrifices to celebrate his victories and giving away gifts to everyone, Vamana approached him and asked for "three steps of land".Mahabali granted him the gift. Vamana then metamorphosed into Vishnu's giant Trivikrama form, taking all of heaven in one step and earth in second. Mahabali realized that the Vamana was none other than Vishnu and offered his own head for the third step. Some Hindu texts state that Mahabali was taken to patala (netherworld), some state he was dragged there by Garuda, in others he entered heaven with the touch of Vishnu, while another version states he became Chiranjeevi (immortal).Others even have Bali admitted into Vaikunta, which was an even higher place than the realm of Devas.
